how do I build an interactive web app dashboard that looks visually appealing and easy to use, it should have links to web resources across 10 topics: General Community Tools, Network, 
Security, Detection Engineering, EDR&NDR&XDR, SIEM, SOC, Incident Response, Threat Intelligence, AI in SecOps and Vulnerability Management. My preference is to use node.js but if this 
doesn't allow for all functionality please tell me how to do this. I am a beginner please give all the code and walk through every step
